# Selectio
> ***sēlēctiō, sēlēctiōnis (f)** - The act of choosing out or selecting; selection, choice.*

# Idea
I learn best by being around people better than me. In each person I know there are characteristics I admire and wish to see in myself, just as there are traits I observe in others that that I wish to avoid in myself.

# Makeup
This will be the best way to learn how to create, structure, and scale ReactJS applications from scratch (a skill that will be invaluable not only later on in life but very soon as I start working on the KidsTales web app.)

# Components
(NodeJS)
- Webpack
- Babel
- React
- Jade
- Google auth
- ExpressJS
- Firebase
- *[TODO] api system*

# Specifics

Check the [projects](https://github.com/Apexal/selectio/projects) page for details.
App consists of adding people manually at first then adding traits to persons whenever I observe them. Specific traits can be selected from each person and a list of them all will be compiled for the ideal list of traits to work on in myself.

## Traits
Traits can be simple things such as `Very natural talker` or morer complex such as `Often leaves homework to the last minute`. Every trait would be assigned `- (negative)`, `+ (positive)`, or maybe `/ (neutral)` to classify them. `+` and `-` classifications are also given a numerical value from `0` to `5` to distingusih tiny flaws from huge character flaws, or tiny manerisms with deep positive composure. 

## Persons
Persons are added manually whenever and can then have specific traits assigned to them when observed. Each person has some associated info such as relation to me, short tag-line, short description of them by me, important quotes by them, etc. The main info associated with each person is a list of traits. Traits are selected from the list of already added ones (or a new one is created and added to the list) such that the same traits are linked the same on different people, which allows me to then search by trait and such.

Each person could be given a rank depending on their list of traits and their weights but this may be a little too objectifying.
